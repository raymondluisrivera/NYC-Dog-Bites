# NYC-Dog-Bites
An analysis of reported dog bites in NYC from 2015-2017
According to the Department of Health Mental Health(DHMH), dog bites were responsible for an average of 6,028 emergency room visits from 2007-2014
(Preventing Dog Bite-Related Injuries among New York City Residents, 2017). The injuries obtained through dog bites are responsible for almost $17 million USD in 
medical expenses for the year of 2014, with children making up the majority of the victims(Preventing Dog Bite-Related Injuries among New York City Residents, 2017). 
The information available focuses on how dog bites relate to victims, but little information actually exist on the dogs themselves or any meaningful trends that can 
be extrapulated from the data. This data analysis will use the DHMH dataset on dog bites in NYC from 2015-2017 to answer the following questions:

    Which dog breeds bite the most?
    In which age range are bites most expected?
    Are there any boroughs in the city that are disproportionately effected by dog bites?
    Does spaying or neutering the dog effect whether they bite people or not?
